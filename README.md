## Hi there, I'm Egil

Right now I'm attending an education to become a front end developer with previous experience in graphic design and 3d-visualization among other creative areas.

Creative problem solving, to organize and keep good structure, and to be professional is who I am.

I recharge my energy when I'm out in nature, hanging out with my dog â€‹â€‹and taking photos.
